<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of this project was to help give not only ourselves, but all other students a way to overcome motivation
  drought and a overwhelming sense of social isolation in their day-to-day academic ongoings. We aimed to acheive this
  by providing a way to have friends be a source of external accountability for those around them, more specifically, a
  social task tracker, with shared goals throughout the week. You must keep your streak going strong, or else your house of accountability
  will start to fall apart and you'll have to downgrade. On the flipside, if you keep a regular schedule and stick to your weekly
  goals, then it's nowhere but up for you, with only accountability house upgrades coming your way!


### Built With

* [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [DJango](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
